Try this out next time for your API testing. It's a postman-type service, but it's an extension. Been working on it for some time.

It should work for all Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Opera [GX], Brave, Vivaldi, etc.)

Postman Mini is a lightweight API testing tool integrated into your browser for quick and easy API requests. With a simple yet intuitive interface, this tool is perfect for all developers needing to use Postman in their browser.

There are boxes for the heading and body, and once the request is sent, you are provided with the result as well as the latency of the process.

If you want any further requests, please just ask! We will try our best to adhere to your requests and make your user experience as smooth as possible!

<h1><b>STEPS TO INSTALL ON ANY CHROMIUM BASED BROWSER</b></h1>

1. Make sure your browser is Chromium-based:
   - My suggestion: just search the name of your browser up in this frame: "Is _______ browser based on chromium".
2. Download all the files into a folder on your computer.
3. Go to your extensions local page
   - Usually something like: "browsername://extensions"
   - You could also alternatively click manage extensions under the top bar.
4. Turn on developer mode.
5. Select "load unpacked".
6. Then select the folder with the files.

Again! Thank you for trying out my extension. If you have any comments or concerns, please report them on the reviews on the Edge Store!
I wish you a great rest of your day!
